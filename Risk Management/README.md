# Risk Management

This folder contains comprehensive resources for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with AI systems. These materials provide frameworks, templates, and tools to establish effective AI risk management practices aligned with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Contents

### Policy and Framework
- **AI Risk Management Policy.docx**: A comprehensive policy document outlining the organization's approach to AI risk management, including roles, responsibilities, and governance structures.

### Assessment and Tracking
- **AI Risk Register Template.xlsx**: An Excel template for maintaining a centralized register of AI risks, including risk descriptions, assessments, mitigation plans, and status tracking.
- **Mock AI Use Case Risk Assessment.docx**: A sample risk assessment document demonstrating how to evaluate risks for a specific AI use case, including methodology and documentation requirements.

### Reference Materials
- **AI Risk Lexicon.xlsx**: A glossary and lexicon of AI-specific risk terms, definitions, and categories to ensure consistent understanding and communication.
- **Control Library for AI Threats.xlsx**: A comprehensive library of controls and countermeasures for addressing various AI-related threats and vulnerabilities.

## How to Use

### Establishing Risk Management Framework
1. **Policy Adoption**: Implement the AI Risk Management Policy as the foundation:
   - Define risk management roles and responsibilities
   - Establish risk appetite and tolerance levels
   - Set governance structures for oversight
   - Define risk assessment methodologies

2. **Lexicon Utilization**: Use the AI Risk Lexicon to:
   - Standardize terminology across the organization
   - Ensure consistent risk categorization
   - Support training and awareness programs

### Risk Assessment Process
1. **Use Case Evaluation**: Follow the Mock AI Use Case Risk Assessment template for new AI implementations:
   - Identify potential risks and impacts
   - Assess likelihood and severity
   - Evaluate existing controls
   - Develop mitigation strategies

2. **Register Maintenance**: Use the AI Risk Register Template to:
   - Track all identified AI risks
   - Monitor risk levels over time
   - Document mitigation actions and owners
   - Report on risk status to stakeholders

### Control Implementation
1. **Control Selection**: Reference the Control Library for AI Threats to:
   - Identify appropriate controls for specific risks
   - Understand implementation requirements
   - Assess control effectiveness
   - Ensure compliance with standards

## Key Risk Management Principles

### Proactive Risk Identification
- Conduct regular risk assessments for all AI systems and use cases.
- Monitor emerging risks from technological advancements and regulatory changes.
- Engage cross-functional teams in risk identification processes.

### Risk-Based Decision Making
- Use quantitative and qualitative risk assessments to inform decisions.
- Balance risk mitigation costs with potential impacts.
- Consider risk appetite when prioritizing mitigation efforts.

### Continuous Monitoring
- Regularly review and update risk registers.
- Monitor the effectiveness of implemented controls.
- Track key risk indicators and early warning signals.

## Integration with Governance Framework

These risk management resources connect with other governance areas:
- **Executive Oversight**: Provide risk status updates for board reporting.
- **Compliance**: Support regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act).
- **Maturity Assessment**: Contribute to evaluating risk management maturity.
- **Incident Response**: Integrate with prompt injection and abuse mitigation plans.

## Risk Categories Addressed
