# Designs and Illustrations

This folder contains visual materials, presentations, and design templates to support AI governance, risk management, and compliance initiatives.

## Contents

### Presentations
- **AI Governance Dashboard.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation template for creating executive dashboards that visualize AI governance metrics, KPIs, and oversight status.
- **AI Governance Maturity Heatmap.pptx**: Presentation slides for displaying maturity assessment results in a visual heatmap format, useful for board presentations and stakeholder communications.
- **AI Risk Dashboard.pptx**: Templates for creating risk-focused dashboards that highlight AI-related risks, mitigation status, and monitoring metrics.

### Templates
- **Risk Heatmap Template.xlsx**: An Excel template for creating risk heatmaps that plot AI risks by likelihood and impact, supporting risk prioritization and reporting.

## How to Use

### Dashboard Presentations
1. **Customize Templates**: Start with the provided PowerPoint templates and customize them with your organization's specific data and branding.
2. **Data Integration**: Connect dashboards to live data sources where possible, or manually update with current metrics.
3. **Audience Adaptation**: Tailor the level of detail and technical complexity based on your audience (executives, technical teams, auditors).

### Risk Heatmap
1. **Risk Identification**: List all identified AI risks in the template.
2. **Scoring**: Assign likelihood and impact scores using your organization's risk scoring methodology.
3. **Visualization**: Use the built-in charting features to create visual risk heatmaps.
4. **Updates**: Regularly refresh the heatmap as new risks emerge or existing risks change.

## Best Practices for Visual Communications

### Design Principles
- Use consistent color schemes and branding across all materials.
- Keep slides uncluttered with clear hierarchies of information.
- Use data visualizations (charts, graphs) to make complex information more digestible.

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on key metrics and trends rather than exhaustive details.
- Include actionable insights and recommendations.
- Use plain language to explain technical concepts.

### Presentation Tips
- Practice timing for executive presentations (typically 10-15 minutes).
- Prepare backup slides with additional details for Q&A sessions.
- Ensure all data sources and methodologies are clearly cited.

## File Formats and Compatibility

- **PowerPoint (.pptx)**: Compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides.
- **Excel (.xlsx)**: Compatible with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
- Consider exporting to PDF for distribution to ensure consistent formatting across different devices.

## Maintenance and Updates

- Review and update templates quarterly to reflect changes in AI governance frameworks.
- Archive previous versions when making significant updates.
- Solicit feedback from users to continuously improve the templates.
